# Medical Chatbot Text Mining Analysis  
**Author:** Hamed Razavi  
**Project Type:** NLP · Topic Modeling · NER · Co-occurrence Analysis

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of medical chatbot conversations using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to understand:

- How symptoms are described by chatbots  
- Which symptoms frequently co-occur  
- The structure of medical conversations  
- Underlying topics across dialogues  

This work supports improved telemedicine systems, symptom evaluation, and patient–chatbot communication.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Extract meaningful insights from unstructured medical conversation text  
- Identify common symptom descriptions  
- Detect co-occurring symptoms using association rule mining  
- Perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract medical concepts  
- Use topic modeling to identify major themes in the conversations
